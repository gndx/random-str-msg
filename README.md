# random-str-msg

Whenever I start a new project, I don't know what to write for the first commit. After doing a “git init” there is technically nothing there...

## Install

```npm
npm install -g random-str-msg
```

## Usage

To get only the message:

```bash
 random-str-msg
```

To make an automatic commit with a random message, pass the argument `--commit`

```bash
 random-str-msg --commit
```

The cli tool will open and allow you to choose the message for your commit and it will automatically do the commit.
